# Neighborhood Maps Project

Author: Jina Chan

Created for: Udacity Front-End Nanodegree (FEND) 2018

## Description
This React web application shows you the best restaurants in Seattle using Google Maps and the Foursquare Places and Photos APIs. You can filter the map markers by entering a query. You can display an infowindow for a restaurant by clicking its marker on the map or clicking the restaurant name below the query field.

The design for this app is based on the [Udacity walkthrough](https://youtu.be/NVAVLCJwAAo) by Doug Brown.
